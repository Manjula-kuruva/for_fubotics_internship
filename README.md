Project Title: Emojify – Facial Expression Recognition

Description:
This project uses AI and deep learning to detect human facial expressions from images or webcam input and then displays a corresponding emoji for the detected emotion. It first detects a face in the image, then classifies the emotional expression (such as happy, sad, angry, surprised, etc.) using a trained convolutional neural network (CNN). Finally, it maps the predicted emotion to a related emoji and shows it to the user.

What I Used:

Machine Learning / Deep Learning: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize emotions from face images.

Dataset: FER-2013 dataset, a benchmark dataset for facial emotion recognition with images labeled into seven emotions.
GitHub

Computer Vision: Face detection using Haar Cascade classifiers (OpenCV) to extract the face region before prediction.
GitHub

Libraries/Tools: TensorFlow / Keras for building and training the neural network, OpenCV for face detection, NumPy for data handling, and potentially other Python libraries.

How It Works:

A face is detected from an image or webcam capture.

The face region is passed to the CNN model.

The model predicts one of several emotions (e.g., happy, sad, neutral).

The corresponding emoji is displayed based on the predicted emotion.

Outcome:
The model successfully classifies facial expressions and displays emojis, demonstrating practical usage of computer vision and deep learning for real-time emotion recognition.
